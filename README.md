Twitter Sentiment Analysis using NLTK, Python
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subset of Machine Learning that focuses on real-world unstructured data. Although computers cannot recognize and interpret string inputs, libraries like as NLTK, TextBlob, and many others have discovered a means to handle strings mathematically. Twitter is a forum where most individuals share their thoughts about the present situation.
The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. To keep things simple, we claim a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist emotion. So the objective is to distinguish between racist and sexist tweets.
